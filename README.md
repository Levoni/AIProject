# Maze Generator and Solver
Project was created for an AI class. The goal was to impliment several different search algorithms that could search through a maze. It has a Graphical interface to allow the user to compare the different search algorithms.

If you are interested in adding to the project feel free. I only ask that you do not edit the current search algorithms.
